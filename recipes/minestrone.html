<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I'm going to keep this brief as no one likes recipes preceded by walls of text, and I'm not even getting ad money.
  Minestrone is a kind of Italian vegetable soup. It's healthy, it's tasty and it's filling.</p>
<p>There are many different recipes for this dish; this is my version, loosely based on a recipe on BBC Good Food.
  If you skip the bread with home-made garlic butter I like to eat with this, it's vegan. I do not include pasta
  as we always eat dinner leftovers for lunch the next day and by that point, pasta gets soggy and gross. It's
  also not hugely necessary, what with there already being potatoes in it and possibly bread to go with it.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Potatoes (about 2 medium-sized)</li>
  <li>Carrot</li>
  <li>Onion</li>
  <li>Garlic (1-2 cloves or as much as you like)</li>
  <li>Celery (about 2 stalks)</li>
  <li>Tinned tomatoes or passata</li>
  <li>Tomato paste</li>
  <li>Green beans (a handful)</li>
  <li>Stock (I use vegetable, 500-750 ml)</li>
  <li>Cannelini beans (1 tin)</li>
  <li>Courgette (1/3 or so of one)</li>
  <li>Savoy cabbage (a few leaves)</li>
  <li>Pepper and cayenne pepper for seasoning</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Wash and chop the celery stalks</li>
  <li>Wash, scrape and chop the carrot</li>
  <li>Peel and chop the onion</li>
  <li>Peel and dice the potatoes</li>
  <li>Heat up some oil in a big pot</li>
  <li>Add the onion, followed shortly after by the carrot, celery and potato</li>
  <li>Fry these while stirring for a few minutes, then put the lid on and turn to the next steps</li>
  <li>Peel and dice the garlic; add it into the pot and stir</li>
  <li>Wash and trim (if necessary) the green beans, then cut into quarters or so and add into the pot</li>
  <li>Prepare the courgette by washing and slicing it, then cutting the slices into halves or quarters</li>
  <li>Add a teaspoonful or so of tomato paste, stir and fry for a moment</li>
  <li>Add the stock and tinned tomatoes and stir</li>
  <li>Drain the cannelini beans and add them, stirring again</li>
  <li>Season with pepper and add just a few dashes of cayenne pepper (the soup should not be spicy, just for some
    extra warmth)</li>
  <li>Let simmer for 5 minutes, then add the courgette and give it another 5</li>
  <li>Wash the savoy leaves and cut into small strips/pieces</li>
  <li>Add the savoy to the soup</li>
  <li>Squish a couple of the pieces of potato against the wall of the pot with your spoon to thicken the soup</li>
  <li>Check seasoning and make sure the green beans and potatoes are cooked</li>
  <li>Serve! Goes well with nice crusty bread or slices of garlic bread</li>
</ol>
