<p><em>(As this recipe is an own creation and I'm not a food photographer, this is an approximation of what it looks like.)</em></p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Halloumi is a delicious squeaky cheese that can be grilled without melting, and works very well for various
  vegetarian recipes.</p>
<p>These sandwiches are largely my husband's creation and reasonably simple just to save me some typing.</p>
<h2>Ingredients (for 2 servings)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ciabatta (1, we like one with olives)</li>
  <li>Halloumi (1 block)</li>
  <li>Avocado (1)</li>
  <li>Optional: A little lemon juice</li>
  <li>Hummus</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Slice the halloumi</li>
  <li>Cook the halloumi in a griddle pan over high heat to give it some nice sear marks and set aside</li>
  <li>Give the ciabatta about 10 minutes at 180 degrees in the oven to crisp it up a little</li>
  <li>Cut the ciabatta into 2 halves and then halve those lengthways</li>
  <li>Cut the avocado in half and discard the pit</li>
  <li>Slice the avocado, add some cracked black pepper and lemon juice if desired</li>
  <li>Mash each avocado half up on one side of each ciabatta half</li>
  <li>Place lettuce on top of the avocado as desired</li>
  <li>Place halloumi slices on top of the lettuce</li>
  <li>Generously spread the other half of each sandwich with hummus</li>
  <li>Place the hummus half on the rest of the sandwich and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
