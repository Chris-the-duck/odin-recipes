<p><em>(This is the general idea, but without the peas. Ick.)</em></p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Creamy risotto is always enjoyable. This one once again involves a lot of eyeballing amounts
according to taste and will work with pretty much any green veggies you like.</p>
<p>I don't put peas in this because I don't like them, but feel free to if you must.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Risotto/Arborio rice</li>
  <li>Butter</li>
  <li>Vegetable stock</li>
  <li>A bit of white wine</li>
  <li>Onion (1)</li>
  <li>Lemon</li>
  <li>Garlic (as much as you like, I use 1-2 cloves)</li>
  <li>Frozen broad beans (can use fresh but why bother peeling them?)</li>
  <li>Whatever green vegetables you want. I like to use courgette and asparagus.</li>
  <li>If there's any savoy left over from the minestrone, that goes well in here too</li>
  <li>Otherwise you can also add spinach, but my husband's not a huge fan</li>
  <li>Cheese (I use cheddar; parmesan isn't vegetarian but if that isn't an issue, go for it)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Peel and chop the onion</li>
  <li>Put some olive oil and butter in a large pan on medium heat until the butter's melted</li>
  <li>Add the onion and cook until softened</li>
  <li>Add the rice and fry until it's all covered in the butter/oil and the smell is slightly nutty</li>
  <li>Add the wine, stir and cook until the liquid has evaporated</li>
  <li>While the wine is cooking off, peel and dice the garlic and add</li>
  <li>Season with pepper</li>
  <li>Add lemon zest if available, or a couple splashes of lemon juice</li>
  <li>Add a couple ladlefuls of stock and let simmer</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, wash/cut/prep all other veg you are using</li>
  <li>I like to saut√© the other vegetables in olive oil in a separate pan and
    get some browning on the courgette, but this step is optional</li>
  <li>Add frozen beans to rice</li>
  <li>Add other vegetables to rice</li>
  <li>Keep stirring and adding more stock a couple ladlefuls at a time until the rice is cooked and
  the risotto looks creamy</li>
  <li>Grate as much cheddar as you like into it and stir</li>
  <li>Check seasoning and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
