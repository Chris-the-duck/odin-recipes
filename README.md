# odin-recipes
Project for The Odin Project to practice the basics of HTML

This project (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes) required
an index.html page linking to three recipe pages, each containing basic HTML boilerplate, an image, an
unordered list of ingredients and an ordered list of steps.

This is purely to practice HTML, we'll apparently be adding CSS later.
